 * The annotation PropertyClass must be applied to all user defined classes

 *
 * Currently, the annotation is used only for detecting whether a given class
 * should be treated as a property container. The system will fail on all
 * classes, where the annotation is missing and which are not considered simple
 * types such as {@code Integer} or {@code UUID}.
